2: Store posts locally
3: Feed local file to algorthm

# Algorithm:
1: Pre-process text
2: feed text to SVM for prediction
3: store predictions in a result file (what will you store? what final output will you provide)

# Algorithm requirement:
- Determining what pre-processing will be used
- Implementing svm 
- Using test data to teach svm. Tune svm in the process
